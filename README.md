# Web_Project

This project is mainly about the interaction between clinicians and patients.
Clinician would create the account for their patients, and patients will constantly record down their personal data (i.e. blood pressure, weight etc.)
Clinician would receive their patients everyday and monitor if their data is in the safe range. If yes, clinician can send messages to 
encourage patients, otherwise clinician can give suggestions to their patients on what they need to do next.
